Run it from anywhere as sudo.

What it actually does
---------------------

RPiNZ is a minimal shell script that will take a clean Raspbian Jessie install and localise it to work in New Zealand.  The following changes are currently working;

* Adds fsmg.org.nz as the default OS repo.
* Updates the package list
* Remove the en_GB locale
* Enable the en_NZ and mi_NZ locales
* Set en_NZ as the default language
* Set the keyboard to work with MƒÅori characters
* Enable macron support in the console
* Set the timezone to Pacific/Auckland
* Set the timeservers to use NZ based servers

Support for Stretch
-------------------

The next version of Raspbian is Stretch and minimal support for this is in place. More testing is needed at this point.
